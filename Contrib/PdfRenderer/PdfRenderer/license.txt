# PdfRenderer licensing


## The long winded explanation

This plugin (PdfRenderer) uses the Ghostscript library, which is licensed [under the GPL v3](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

Therefore, this plugin (PdfRenderer) is also made available under the GPL v3, 
as the current version links dynamically to the Ghostscript library. 

While the GPL v3 does not allow us to license the binaries under the MIT license 
(since they are derivative works when used with the Ghostscript DLLs),
we can license the source under the MIT license. 

This allows any future user to take the source code and modify it to either 

 * (a) not use ghostscript, or 
 * (b) use ghostscript via an external executable, and therefore lift the GPL v3 requirement.

Be aware that (unlike any of the other plugins), this places restrictions on the binaries of any code 
that uses the PdfRenderer plugin; because it too becomes under the GPL, 
in addition to any other license it is under.

If you are not distributing binaries of your code which uses the PdfRenderer plugin, 
or are only using them on your web server, it is unlikely you need to be concerned about this.

However, **if you are including this plugin as part of a product or deliverable, 
you should make sure you understand the implications**.

One way to fix this licensing problem would be to have a version which uses the 
GhostScript executables instead of the DLL. It may have reduced performance, 
but would not require the plugin to be GPL licensed.

**To sum up: Compiled versions which use Ghostscript are under the GPL v3. Source is under MIT or GPL v3, your pick**.
