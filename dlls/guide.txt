# Which dlls to use

ImageResizer.dll is always required. It includes all Basic plugins except Caption

Each plugin has a identically named DLL that is obviously needed.

The PsdReader plugin also requires PsdFile.dll
The S3Reader plugin also requires LitS3.dll
The AdvancedFilters and WhitespaceTrimmer plugins require all AForge dlls
The BatchTrimmer plugin requires Ionic.Zip.Reduced.dll

It is suggested that you also copy the matching pdb files as well, as this will greatly assist debugging.
