## Settings

height: the height to set the container. 
width: the width to set the container.

panes: ['rotateflip','crop','adjust', 'redeye','objectremoval','effects'] //A list of panes to display

strings: {
paneRotateFlip: "Rotate & Flip"



API

call $('div').ImageStudio('api') to get the object.


## Division of responsibility:

It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that jQuery, jQuery UI, ImageResizing.js, ImageStudio.js, jQuery UI CSS, and JCrop CSS are are all loaded. Dynamic loading is not yet implemented.



## Feature idea

Zoom tool - load a high-res version and display it, following the cursor, using css like the preview window.

# List of bugs and edge cases to fix

Rotation and flip will need to translate crop, red-eye, and object removal coordinates if present.

Filters that use a radius (like sharpen, blur, painting, and posterize) need to use source-relative numbers or percentages of the width/height so resized versions don't appear vastly different.

# Some effects should be disabled during crop, red-eye, and object removal:  

* Drop Shadow
* Glow
* Border
* Margin
* Padding


# Stuff that could eventually be added 

* Encoding
* Background color
* Select page or frame (we'd need a meta API to find the ranges). 
* catmullrom or lanczos resizing filter





Flip/rotate could happen in CSS until the new image loads: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1309055/cross-browser-way-to-flip-html-image-via-javascript-css
And use jQueryRotate to help the user follow (potenetially)
