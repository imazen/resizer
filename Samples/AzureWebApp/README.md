# Azure Samples

The Azure samples are currently configured to use Azure SDK 1.x.  If you want to
use Azure SDK 2.x, you can allow Visual Studio to migrate the projects for you.
Additionally, you will need to change the two entries in AzureWebImages/Web.config
from the "Azure SDK 1.x" values to the "Azure SDK 2.x" values.
