# Bugs

Settings serializion path should be simpler and correct. Currently, the drop-down is not serialized or deserialized, and resets each app start. 
I'm not sure even the querystring is serialized properly

App should not crash when settings file is missing. It should be created when missing, and probably stored in User profile\app data, not with the exe.

Process stays running after it is closed.

# Incorrect behavior

Message boxes shouldn't ever be displayed when dragging or pasting files into the box.
Destination path should be editable.
lowercase filename extensions should be used.

# Code cleanup

Extract background worker to class.
ResizeMode should use an enumeration instead of magic numbers
Region areas should be removed - they're counterproductive, and make it harder to read code. Generally, they're a sign that the class needs to be broken down into smaller pieces.
Remove all uneeded dependencies.

# Design

Apply good typographic principles,
