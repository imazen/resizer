            <remarks>
            In specific circumstances, the S3 request will hang indefinitely if Expect100Continue is 
            set to true and S3 immediately responds with a HTTP 5xx server error after the request is 
            issued and before any data is written to the stream. The downside to leaving this property 
            at false is that you'll waste bandwidth and time if S3 knows the PUT is going to fail at 
            the very start of the request.

            Gets a collection where you can store name/value metadata pairs to be stored along

            to ASCII encoding. Additionally, Amazon imposes a 2k limit on the total HTTP header

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            One use of this header is to cause a browser to download this resource as a file attachment
            instead of displaying it inline. For that behavior, use a string like:
            "Content-disposition: attachment; filename=mytextfile.txt"

            <summary>
            Creates a pre-authorized URI valid for performing a GET on the given S3 object
            in the given bucket. This is useful for constructing a URL to hand over to a 3rd party
            (such as a web browser). The Uri will automatically expire after the time given.
            This method itself does not communicate with S3 and will return immediately.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            You might expect this method to return a System.Uri instead of a string. It turns out
            there is a tricky issue with constructing Uri objects from these pre-authenticated
            url strings: The Uri.ToString() method will convert a properly-encoded "+" character back
            into a raw "+", which is interpreted by Amazon S3 as a space (standard URI conventions).
            So the signature will be misread if you were to take the Uri.ToString() and feed
            it to a browser. So instead, we'll give you a properly escaped URL string which 
            will always work in a browser. If you want to, say, use it in a WebRequest instead, 
            it turns out that WebRequest will leave it escaped properly and everything will work.
