# ImageResizer - Installing for COM applications

If you are using ImageResizer on a web-facing system, consider using the URL API instead - it has better performance and is much lower maintenance.

No additional steps need to be taken for Classic ASP (or any other language) using the URL API.

### Installing ImageResizer for COM use

1. [Download ImageResizer](/download) and extract it to a folder.
2. Run `\dlls\release\COMInstaller.exe` within the extracted folder, *with Administrator privileges*.
3. Click Install, and verify success.

If you get an error when trying to use the COM API, see [the troubleshooting page](/docs/troubleshoot).

### Using the COM API
