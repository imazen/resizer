# ImageResizer




### Notes for developers working on the code base

* Make sure you have NuGet 2.7 installed with package restore enabled
* If you have Visual Studio 2008/2010, don't try to open the unit tests (they require .NET 4.5)


We use Visual Studio 2012 & 2013 internally for development


This repository contains all ImageResizer core and plugin code, with history back to V1.
