Verify all Build overloads handle streams appropriately with unit tests. We don't want any regressions.

InterceptModule in VppUsageMode.Fallback will serve a physical gradient.png file instead of the virtual gradient.png file.

PathUtils

ResponseHeaders.DefaultApplyToResponseMethod

Configuration.Issues.IssueSink
Configuration.Xml.* (everything)
Configuration.Config.cs (how does it work with no config???)
''.get ... Shouldn't these log issues instead of throwing exceptions?

PluginConfig.GetPluginType
PluginConfig.removeBy, clearBy

SafeList
ReverseEnumerator
DefaultEncoder.AcceptedImageExtensions

validate issues are raised properly


ImageBuilder
LayoutBuilder (needs docs updated)
ResizeSettings (needs 'normalization' method and improved querystring parsing)
Utils

InterceptModule

Verify filenames with a & are handled properly

start with an image that has a 1px outer border of black and resize it, verifying that a border of 30% black or more remains.
