# DefaultEncoder

Installed by default. 

Provides adjustable JPEG encoding, 32-bit PNG encoding with transparency support, and standard .NET GIF encoding (which is quite lousy, and does not support transparency). Get the PrettyGifs plugin for high-quality GIF encoding.

Jpeg quality defaults to 90, which is very good balance. You can override the setting by adding &quality=0-100

You can choose the file format with &format=png|jpg|gif
