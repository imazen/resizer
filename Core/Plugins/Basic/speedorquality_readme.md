# SpeedOrQuality

*PLEASE NOTE*
* **This plugin will be removed in a future major release.**
* **For forwards-compatibility with ImageResizer and Imageflow, avoid use.**


Gain a 15-30% speed boost by sacrificing rendering quality.


## Installation

1. Add `<add name="SpeedOrQuality" />` to the `<plugins>` section.


## Usage

Add `&speed=value` to any image URL. 

Value chart

* 0 - Highest quality
* 1 - High quality bilinear, but with low quality pixel offset, smoothing, composing, and compositing quality.
* 2 - Low quality bilinear
* 3 - GetThumbnailImage() is used. This can produce extremely bad (but instant) results when an image has an embedded Exif thumbnail (most cameras embed these).

## Notes

Resizing is usually the least expensive part of image resizing - JPEG decoding and encoding take most of the time. This plugin can sometimes speed up resizing by 1.5-3x (or more if there is a thumbnail image and you are using &speed=3), but it probably doesn't matter much - the overall savings are likely less than 20%.
