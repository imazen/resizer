# Manual algorithm

After extensive analysis, it appears that using the same algorithm for both red-eye detection systems would be counterproductive.


### Accuracy of click

1. It can be reasonably expected that users will click within 25 display pixels of the eye.
2. By searching that radius from the click for the reddest pixel, while applying a distance curve factor to prefer close matches, it should be possible to reliably grab a red pixel. 
To eliminate stray pixels (such as red dots on the eyelid), the search area (25 display pixels) radius should be 
resampled to a low-resolution area (say 15x15) (prior to red eval) so only major blobs are counted. 
The search is repeated using the scale factor as a radius and the max point as the origin to get an real pixel.

### Adaptive flood fill thresholding

The max pixel provides an upper bound for our intensity expectations.

A maximum search radius is provided by 0.05 * max(width/height)

Search should occur simultaneously in all directions. Local thresholding sensitivity is determined by two variables. (a) distance from click, and (b) distance from current weighted center of fill.

Once complete, the final weighted center can be used to re-analyze red area
