This plugin requires 'manual' installation due to the number of configuration opetions that must be set.
A configuration syntax may be established once the plugin has evolved more.

This is how to install and configure the plugin:

1) Copy the DLL to the bin folder, or include the source file in your project

2) Use this code to configure and register the plugin with the pipeline

ImageResizer.Plugins.Watermark.WatermarkPlugin w = new ImageResizer.Plugins.Watermark.WatermarkPlugin();
w.align = System.Drawing.ContentAlignment.BottomLeft;
w.hideIfTooSmall = true;
w.keepAspectRatio = true;
w.valuesPercentages = false;
w.watermarkDir = "~/watermarks/"; //Where the watermark plugin looks for the image specifed in the querystring ?watermark=file.png
w.bottomRightPadding = new System.Drawing.SizeF(20, 20);
w.topLeftPadding = new System.Drawing.SizeF(20, 20);
w.watermarkSize = new System.Drawing.SizeF(30, 30); //The desired size of the watermark, maximum dimensions (aspect ratio maintained if keepAspectRatio = true)
//Install the plugin
w.Install(ImageResizer.Configuration.Config.Current); 

It is recommended that you execute the above code during Application_Start.

This can be done in the Global.asax or Global.asax.cs file:

void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e) 
{
	//Insert code here

}
